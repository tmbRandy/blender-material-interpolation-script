This python script can help you when you import Minecraft Worlds into blender which have been converted with Mineways. This tool makes a great job, but unfortunately it doesn't set the interpolation mode for all materials to closest. So all materials have a washed out look by default. To change it, you would normally go through all materials of an object and change their interpolation mode which can be a lot of work. This script can help you to do this automatically.
