# Description
This python script can help you when you import Minecraft Worlds into blender which have been converted with Mineways. This tool makes a great job, but unfortunately it doesn't set the interpolation mode for all materials to closest. So all materials have a washed out look by default. To change it, you would normally go through all materials of an object and change their interpolation mode which can be a lot of work. This script can help you to do this automatically.

## How to use it
Import your Mineways exported 3D model into blender. Then you go to the Script tab and paste the code from run.py. Click the run button. Now you can go back to the Layout tab and select your model in Object Mode. Open the Object Menu at the top of the viewport and click Set texture interpolation. Now your Model should look like it does in Minecraft.
